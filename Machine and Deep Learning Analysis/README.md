Comprehensive Data Science Project Report
1. Introduction

This report summarizes a comprehensive data science journey undertaken over a series of projects using six different datasets. 
The objective was to explore the power of data science through end-to-end solutions for real-world problems. Each dataset was 
chosen to highlight specific use cases across industries such as telecommunications, finance, real estate, natural sciences, and NLP.
We applied a wide range of algorithms including regression models, classification algorithms, clustering techniques, support vector machines, 
and neural networks. This report provides detailed insights into preprocessing, modeling, performance evaluation, and final recommendations.

2. Datasets Used

1. Telecom Customer Churn – To identify customers likely to leave.
2. Iris Dataset – A classic dataset for multiclass classification.
3. House Price Prediction – Real estate data used for regression modeling.
4. Sentiment Analysis Dataset – Text data used for binary classification of positive/negative sentiment.
5. Stock Prices Dataset – Time series data to analyze financial trends.
6. KMeans Synthetic Data – Unsupervised clustering demonstration.

3. Data Preprocessing

Each dataset required careful preprocessing:
- Missing values were handled using either deletion or imputation strategies.
- Categorical encoding (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder) was applied to non-numeric features.
- Scaling with StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler improved model convergence.
- Text data was vectorized using TF-IDF for sentiment analysis.
- Dimensionality reduction and feature selection helped improve performance for some models.

4. Machine Learning Algorithms Used
4.1 Logistic Regression

Applied on churn and sentiment datasets. Logistic Regression was used as a baseline classifier for binary outcomes. It provided interpretable coefficients 
and performed reasonably well on the churn dataset with accuracy around 79% and AUC around 0.85.

4.2 Linear Regression

Used for the house price prediction task. Linear Regression captured the linear relationships between numeric features like area, number of rooms, and price.
Performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² score. R² achieved was 0.74, indicating strong predictive power.

4.3 Decision Tree Classifier

Applied on the churn and iris datasets. The tree structure provided interpretability and feature importance insights. For churn data, accuracy was around 81% 
with F1 score of 0.76. For iris, accuracy reached over 95%.

4.4 Random Forest

This ensemble model improved accuracy on churn and iris datasets by reducing overfitting. Feature importance showed 'Customer Service Calls' and 'International Plan' 
as key churn predictors. On churn data, accuracy improved to 83% with AUC over 0.87.

4.5 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Used on iris and churn datasets. The KNN classifier achieved over 96% accuracy on the iris dataset and around 78% on churn. Hyperparameter tuning (K value) 
was done using cross-validation.

4.6 KMeans Clustering

Demonstrated unsupervised learning on synthetic and churn data. We used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. The model identified 
groups of customers with similar behavior. Clustering results helped segment customer types.

4.7 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Implemented on churn and iris datasets with both linear and RBF kernels. After using class balancing, linear kernel improved recall and F1 score.
RBF kernel helped in nonlinear separation. AUC reached 0.89 on churn data.

4.8 Feedforward Neural Network

Built using TensorFlow/Keras for churn analysis. Used ReLU activation in hidden layers and sigmoid in output layer. Achieved accuracy over 83% on 
churn data and 85% on sentiment. Training and validation losses were visualized to monitor overfitting.

5. Evaluation Metrics

All models were evaluated using appropriate metrics:
- Accuracy – % of correct predictions.
- Precision – Relevant churners correctly identified.
- Recall – How many actual churners we caught.
- F1 Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- AUC (ROC Curve) – Classifier's ability to distinguish churners from non-churners.
- Confusion Matrix – Provided TP, TN, FP, FN insights.
- R², RMSE, MAE – Used for regression tasks (house price, stock).

6. Key Findings

- Churn prediction: Neural Networks and Random Forest performed the best.
- Sentiment Analysis: Logistic Regression and KMEANS gave excellent classification performance.
- Iris: SVM and KNN achieved near-perfect classification.
- House prices: Linear Regression gave good results, but could be improved with ensemble regressors.
- Stock prices: Time series nature requires LSTM or ARIMA for deeper insights (scope for future work).

7. Conclusion and Recommendations

This multi-dataset data science initiative showcased the importance of algorithm selection, preprocessing, and metric evaluation. 
Neural networks showed superior performance but required careful tuning. Simpler models like logistic regression still provided interpretable insights. 
For businesses, using churn predictions to launch customer retention campaigns or house price models for real estate listings can lead to strong ROI.

For future projects, deeper NLP models (BERT) or time series forecasting techniques (LSTM, Prophet) can be explored.
