# Data Science Portfolio  

This repository highlights my **machine learning, NLP, and predictive analytics projects**, focusing on end-to-end implementation from data preparation to deployment.  

## What’s Inside:  
- **Churn & Fraud Detection Models** – Achieved up to 92% precision  
- **Time-Series Forecasting** – Improved demand prediction accuracy by 20%  
- **NLP Applications** – Topic modeling, sentiment analysis, LLM integrations  
- **MLOps Deployments** – Azure pipelines with MLflow & Docker for monitoring & scalability  

## Tools & Skills:  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) | SQL | NLP | Azure (Data Factory, ML Services) | Docker | MLflow | Predictive Modeling | Feature Engineering  

Each project folder includes a **README.md** with:  
- Problem statement & business context  
- Technical workflow  
- Model results & evaluation metrics  
- Deployment notes
